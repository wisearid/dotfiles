welcome to my dotfiles

i honestly have no idea why your reading this but most of these configs were done by some idiot who knows next to nothing about what they're doing, if you really want to take your chance with these be my guest.

To install this bullshit run install.sh in your terminal and after your done delete that terminal because your using my terminal build now.

PLANS

make something for greetd
